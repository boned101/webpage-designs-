            <div id="intro" ><h2 class="heading-one">What is a Cyber Attack?</h2><p class="heading-sub">A cyberattack is a malicious and deliberate attempt by an individual or organization to breach the information system of another individual or organization. Usually, the attacker seeks some type of benefits from disrupting the victim's network.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="No1" ><h2 class="heading-one">1. Malware</h2><p class="heading-sub">Malware is a program designed to gain access to computer systems, normally for the benefit of some third party, without the user’s permission. Malware includes computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware and other malicious programs.</p>

            <div id="No2" ><h2 class="heading-one">2. Phishing</h2><p class="heading-sub">Phishing is fraudulent action of sending spam emails by imitating to be from any legitimate source. At its center, phishing abuses human motivations through alluring message or offer. Aggressors as rule resort to phishing assaults by focusing on huge gatherings and subsequently increment the odds of probably few targets succumbing to assault. A commonplace case of phishing assault includes aggressor mimicking individual or foundation and sends messages to clueless targets requesting prompt assistance with connection appended to correspondence. Guiltless client taps on connection, which takes them to phony site that appears to be like real site. Individual, uninformed of snare, falls into it and winds up offering individual subtleties to aggressor, who at that point ransacks client even before they understand that they have been assaulted.</p>

            <div id="No3" ><h2 class="heading-one">3. Man-in-the-middle Attack</h2><p class="heading-sub">In a web application, there are two actors usually: the client and the server. The third entity that remains unnoticed most of the times is the communication channel. This channel can be a wired connection or a wireless one. There can be one or more servers in the way forwarding your request to the destination server in the most efficient way possible. These are known as Proxy servers. When there is an unwanted proxy in the network intercepting and modifying the requests/responses, this proxy is called a Man in the middle. The network then is said to be under a Man in the middle attack. The interesting point lies in the fact that this rogue proxy is often misunderstood as a legitimate endpoint in a communication by the other endpoint. (It works as a server for the client and as a client for the server).</p>

            <div id="No4" ><h2 class="heading-one">4. Denial-of-service Attack</h2><p class="heading-sub">Denial of Service (DoS) is a cyber-attack on an individual Computer or Website with intent to deny services to intended users.Their purpose is to disrupt an organization’s network operations by denying access to its users.Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with surplus requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled. For example, if a bank website can handle 10 people a second clicking the Login button, an attacker only has to send 10 fake requests per second to make it so no legitimate users can login.</p>
